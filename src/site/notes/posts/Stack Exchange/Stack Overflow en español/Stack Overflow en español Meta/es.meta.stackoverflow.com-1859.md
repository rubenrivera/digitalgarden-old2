# Limpieza de comentarios

En https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19756/289691 se indica que los comentarios son eliminados luego de que varios miembros los reportan o bien luego de que un moderador diamantado los elimina.

Extracto del enlace indicado arriba:

> ## Who can delete comments? 
> 
> A user may delete one of his own comments by clicking on the (x) icon
> that appears to the right of the comment's timestamp when the comment
> is moused over. A user can delete only one comment every five seconds.
> 
> Comments that are flagged by multiple users are deleted automatically.
> The number of flags needed is [based on the comment's
> score](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138168/reduce-the-threshold-for-comment-deletion-with-flags?lq=1#comment388189_138168).  It currently takes "`3 + (Score / 3)`" flags to delete a comment.
> 
> Moderators can delete any comment, or purge *all* comments from a
> post.

> ## When should comments be deleted?
> 
> [Comments are temporary "Post-It" notes left on a question or
> answer](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/privileges/comment). You should
> not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification has been
> made, an edit added to the post to include new information, or the
> issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to deletion.
> In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain untouched due to
> the high volume of comments posted, but this does not mean that they
> can't or shouldn't be deleted in the future.
