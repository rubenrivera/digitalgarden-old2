# StackScraper - export questions as JSON or HTML

The script is not working. 

1. `.post-menu` is now `.js-post-menu`
2. BlobBuilder was deprecated.

On my copy, I applied corrections to fix the above. That was enough to get an output. There are still other changes, like updating the other classes' names, but I'm unfamiliar with CoffeeScript.
